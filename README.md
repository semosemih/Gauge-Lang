# Overview
This repository contains a small programming language implemented from scratch in C++.
The goal of this project is not performance or production readiness, but to deeply
understand how modern programming languages are built under the hood.

The language will include:
- A hand-written lexer and recursive descent parser
- An AST-based interpreter
- Lexical scoping and closures
- First-class functions
